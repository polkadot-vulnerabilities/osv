  "details": "Hyperbridge is a hyper-scalable coprocessor for verifiable, cross-chain interoperability. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the `ismp-grandpa` crate, allowing a malicious prover to easily convince the verifier of the finality of arbitrary headers. This could be exploited to steal funds or compromise cross-chain applications.",
