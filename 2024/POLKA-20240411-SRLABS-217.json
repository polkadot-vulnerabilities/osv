  "summary": "A vulnerability in the XCM system allows third-party accounts to mint an indefinite amount of new tokens and create up to 2**32 sufficient accounts without paying an adequate storage deposit, leading to potential storage exhaustion in the parachain.",
  "details": "If the `min_balance` value is set too low, an unprivileged third-party can exploit this vulnerability by purchasing assets and distributing them to millions of fake accounts, exhausting storage resources in the parachain. This occurs when a sufficient asset setting is enabled, allowing for assets to be held without a corresponding storage deposit. The exploit results in a large number of accounts consuming storage without adequate compensation.",
