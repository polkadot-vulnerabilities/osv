  "summary": "A vulnerability in XCMv4 and XCMv2 allows bypassing the `MAX_INSTRUCTIONS_TO_DECODE` limit, which can lead to memory exhaustion. The limit is enforced in XCMv3 but missing in XCMv4 and XCMv2.",
  "details": "In XCMv3, a limit on the number of instructions that can be decoded for one XCM is enforced by `MAX_INSTRUCTIONS_TO_DECODE = 100`. However, this limit is not enforced in XCMv4 and XCMv2. This allows a malicious user to bypass the restriction, potentially causing memory exhaustion. The vulnerability poses a risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if the limit is not enforced across all XCM versions.",
