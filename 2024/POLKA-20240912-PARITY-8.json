  "summary": "A bug in the migrations pallet can cause a chain to get stuck when using Multi-Block-Migrations (MBM) with a single MBM configured.",
  "details": "This issue occurs in chains using the `pallet-migrations` and `frame-support` system. It affects parachains by potentially causing them to become stuck due to a migration error when using a single index for the MBM feature. The bug was introduced during the development of MBM [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1781) and was discovered during debugging of [paritytech/try-runtime-cli#90](https://github.com/paritytech/try-runtime-cli/pull/90).",
