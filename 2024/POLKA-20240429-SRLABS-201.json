  "summary": "A vulnerability in DMP processing allows an attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against parachains by queuing a large number of messages, leading to memory exhaustion and preventing new block production.",
  "details": "This vulnerability occurs when an attacker prevents block production on a parachain for several relay chain blocks, such as through a network-level DoS attack or by intentionally failing to make chunks for a candidate block available. This leads to an accumulation of pending messages to a parachain. When there are too many pending messages, the parachain becomes unable to produce new blocks due to exceeding the PoV size limit while attempting to process the queued messages in a single block. The only recovery method is through governance intervention on the relay chain.",
