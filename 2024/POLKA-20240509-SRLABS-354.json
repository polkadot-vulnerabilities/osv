  "summary": "A vulnerability in XCM allows attackers to abuse the `RECURSION_LIMIT` to discard overweight messages without execution, potentially causing disruptions and loss of user funds.",
  "details": "An attacker can exploit the XCM `RECURSION_LIMIT` by triggering it and using `execute_overweight` through local calls like `pallet_xcm.execute` on Kusama. This forces the system to drop the message after partial processing, resulting in an `Outcome::Incomplete`, which incorrectly translates to `MessageExecutionStatus::Processed`. This flaw allows attackers to discard overweight messages without execution, potentially disrupting cross-chain operations and leading to the loss of user funds if the discarded message contains a reserve transfer or teleport.",
