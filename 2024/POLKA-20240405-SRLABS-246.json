  "summary": "Attackers can break the `delegate_call` workflow by uploading target code first and removing it later, temporarily breaking the functionality of legitimate smart contracts.",
  "details": "This vulnerability affects all parachains using `pallet-contracts` and relates to an implementation flaw in the `delegate_call` function. Attackers can exploit the system by being the first to upload target code and later removing the code, which disrupts the `delegate_call` workflow. This breaks the functionality implemented in legitimate smart contracts until the code is re-uploaded.",
