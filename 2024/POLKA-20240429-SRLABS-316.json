  "summary": "A vulnerability in FRAME allows a single maximum-sized message to stall an HRMP (Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing) channel, causing a permanent blockage in message transmission.",
  "details": "This vulnerability occurs when a message that exactly reaches the maximum allowed size is sent. The additional encoding data causes the message size to exceed the limit, resulting in the message being stored in a new page that is too large to be transmitted via HRMP. Since the outbound details for the channel are not updated, the channel becomes permanently stalled, blocking further message transmission. This issue was resolved after an extended period, requiring disclosure.",
