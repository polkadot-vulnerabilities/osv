  "summary": "A vulnerability in XCM processing can lead to memory exhaustion during the decoding of XCM instructions in `pallet_xcm.send` and `pallet_xcm.execute` calls, potentially allowing attackers to monopolize block production through transaction censorship.",
  "details": "This vulnerability arises when decoding XCM instructions, where instructions like `ClearOrigin` encode to a single byte but decode to an in-memory size of 1344 bytes. This discrepancy results in extensive memory usage when processing large XCM payloads, potentially causing the wasm runtime to run out of memory and invalidate the block. While XCMv4 reduces the in-memory size from 1344 to 96 bytes, the vulnerability remains for XCMv2/XCMv3 payloads. Attackers can exploit this to cause memory exhaustion, leading to block invalidation or transaction censorship by monopolizing block production.",
