  "summary": "Attackers can exhaust the PoV size without exceeding the proof_size weight limit. Depending on the business logic of the parachain it may be possible to permanently stall the chain by exceeding the PoV size with forced execution via on_initialize/on_idle or incoming XCM messages.",
  "details": "The PoV size benchmarking introduced in [substrate#11637](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11637) assumes the Trie is balanced and the number of layers is bound by `log16(Items)`. An attacker can generate specially crafted storage keys to dis-balance the Trie with a realistic amount of computational effort, resulting in more `log16(Items)` layers and thereby more node lookups than the benchmarking anticipated.",
