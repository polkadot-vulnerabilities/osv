  "summary": "The vesting pallet was designed with restrictions on locked funds; users cannot transfer funds until the vesting schedule allows. However, a bug exists which allows transaction fees and tips to be deducted from the unvested balance.",
  "details": "While the fees are relatively unproblematic since 80% of the fees go to the treasury (and only 20% to the block author), the tips will go directly to the block author. This effectively allows bypassing the vesting restrictions if the user is operating (or bribing) a validator by just submitting a transaction with a huge tip privately to the cooperating validator, after the tips have been transferred to the author the funds can be freely spent without any vesting restrictions.",
