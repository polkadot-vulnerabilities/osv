  "summary": "The limit MAX_ITEMS_IN_MULTIASSETS is not enforced, allowing a single WithdrawAsset instruction to withdraw a large number of assets simultaneously, consuming significant weight and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "details": "This vulnerability arises from the missing enforcement of the MAX_ITEMS_IN_MULTIASSETS limit in XCM. As a result, attackers can exploit this flaw to execute a single WithdrawAsset instruction that withdraws an excessive number of assets at once, leading to high resource consumption and potentially overwhelming the system.",
