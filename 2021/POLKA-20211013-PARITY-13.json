  "summary": "Validity check for signed Frontier-specific extrinsic not called in block execution",
  "details": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators could take advantage of this to insert invalid transactions into a block. The attack is somewhat limited because the signature is always validated, and most of the validation is performed again in the `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, a chain ID replay attack was possible, and spamming attacks posed a concern, though they were limited by Substrate's block size restrictions. The issue was patched in commit `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.",
