  "summary": "Specification non-compliance in JUMPI",
  "details": "The evm crate is a pure Rust implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In affected versions (<0.31.0), the `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, in Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should occur before the destination validity check. This deviation from the specification presents a high-severity risk for Ethereum mainnet users and requires an immediate update to version 0.31.0 or later. Users leveraging the evm crate in Frontier or standalone blockchains face a lower severity issue, as there is no direct exploit path. However, these users should ensure all necessary chain upgrade preparations before updating.",
